        <h1>Hello, my name is Long Ming Wei, an aspiring web/software/game developer!</h1>

    <div id="About" style="display: none;">
        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my personal website! I'm thrilled to have you here. Allow me to introduce myselfâ€”I'm a passionate computer science and business student with an insatiable curiosity for all things web, software, and game development.</p>
<p>Throughout my academic journey, I've been constantly driven by a desire to learn and grow. Initially, I underestimated my own abilities and often found myself stuck in my comfort zone. However, as I embarked on this path, I quickly realized that the only way to truly excel is by challenging oneself and embracing new experiences.</p>
<p>With a combination of determination and a willingness to push my boundaries, I started exploring the vast world of web development. The power to create something tangible out of lines of code fascinated me. I delved into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, learning how to craft beautiful and functional websites that came to life with every click.</p>
<p>Eager to expand my horizons, I decided to venture into the realm of software development. I dabbled in various programming languages, honing my skills in C++, Python, and Java. The ability to create applications that could simplify tasks and improve lives was incredibly rewarding. From simple console programs to more complex applications, I relished the challenge of turning ideas into reality.</p>
<p>But my thirst for knowledge didn't stop there. I was captivated by the art of game development, where imagination and technical prowess merge to create immersive experiences. With Unity, I embarked on exciting 2D and 3D projects, combining programming logic, artistic design, and storytelling to craft interactive worlds.</p>
<p>Throughout my journey, I've come to appreciate the immense potential within myself. By continually stepping out of my comfort zone, I have grown both personally and professionally. I've discovered that limitations are merely illusions, and with the right mindset and dedication, I can surpass my own expectations.</p>
<p>This website serves as a testament to my growth and showcases the projects I've undertaken. Join me as I continue to explore new frontiers, sharpen my skills, and embrace the never-ending journey of learning and development. I'm excited to share my experiences, insights, and creations with you, and I hope you'll find inspiration and enjoyment in this digital space.</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to connecting with you!</p>
