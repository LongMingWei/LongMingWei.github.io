        <h1>Hello World! I am Ming Wei, an aspiring web/software/game developer!</h1>
    </div>
    <div id="About" style="display: none;">
        <h1><strong>About Me</strong></h1>
        <h3>Welcome to my personal website! I'm thrilled to have you here. Allow me to introduce myself â€” I'm a passionate, versatile and open-minded computer science and business student who is seeking real world opportunities to leverage and enhance his existing skills while acquiring new ones through expert mentorship and practical application.</h3>
<h3>During the early stages of my academic journey, I underestimated my own abilities and often found myself stuck in my comfort zone. However, as I found myself outperforming my own expectations when completing tasks under pressure, I quickly realized that the only way to truly upgrade (just like this website) is by challenging oneself and embracing new experiences, thus starting to take the initiative to participate in school clubs and hackathons.</h3>
<h3>I have also self-taught fundamentals of various technical skills that enable me to express and expand my creativity, one of them being web development. I delved into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, learning how to craft beautiful and functional websites that came to life with every click. I also learnt the importance of designing websites based on user experience as they should be easy to read, navigate and use.</h3>
<h3>Eager to expand my horizons, I also decided to venture into the realm of software development. I dabbled in various programming languages, honing my skills in C#, Python, and Java. The ability to create applications that could simplify tasks and improve lives and the fact that I could take pride and ownership in my work was incredibly rewarding. From simple console programs to more complex applications, I relished the challenge of turning ideas into reality.</h3>
<h3>I was even more captivated by the art of game development. Being an avid gamer myself, I was captivated by the immersive and unforgettable experiences that the gaming world offered. These experiences not only brought me joy but also ignited a deep sense of inspiration for the passionate developers who brought them to life, regardless of the size and budget of their creations or studios. With the power of Unity, I embarked on exciting 2D and 3D projects, bringing my imaginations to life while learning the importance of game design and player experience and how implementing seemingly simple game mechanics is harder than it seems which can be so easily overlooked by most players.</h3>
<h3>Throughout my journey, I've come to appreciate the immense potential within myself. By continually stepping out of my comfort zone, I have grown both personally and professionally. I've discovered that limitations are merely illusions, and with the right mindset and dedication, I can surpass my own expectations.</h3>
<h3>This website serves as a testament to my growth and showcases the projects I've undertaken. Join me as I continue to explore new frontiers, sharpen my skills, and embrace the never-ending journey of learning and development. I'm excited to share my experiences, insights, and creations with you, and I hope you'll find inspiration and enjoyment in this digital space.</h3>
<h3>Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to connecting and maybe even collaborate on exciting projects with you!</h3>
